# 🚗 USA Car Accidents EDA-Dashboard (2016–2023)



This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of car accidents in the United States from January 2016 to March 2023 using a comprehensive dataset of over 7 million records.



### 🔍 About the Analysis

The goal is to uncover patterns and insights related to:



Day of the week:

Which days have the highest accident frequencies? How do weekends compare to weekdays?



State and City level trends:

Which states and cities experience more accidents? Are some regions consistently riskier?



Time of day:

What hours show peak accident occurrences? How does rush hour affect accident rates?



Fatality analysis:

Identifying when and where fatal accidents occur, and their relationship to time, weather, and location.



Weather conditions:

How do different weather types (rain, snow, fog, clear skies) impact accident rates and severity?



### 🛠 Features
